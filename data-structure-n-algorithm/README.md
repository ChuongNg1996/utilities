## Tutorial

* [tutorialspoint-DSA-Home](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm): **Problems?** (1) Speed and (2) Multiple Request **Application?** `Search, Sort, Insert, Update, Delete` (e.g, Fibonacci number series, Knapsack problem, Tower of Hanoi, All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall, Shortest path by Dijkstra, Project scheduling)
* [tutorialspoint-DSA-Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/data_structure_overview.htm):

  Foundation Terms: **Interface** is *set of operations* with *type of parameters* and *return type*, **Implementation** provides *internal representation* of a data structure* and *definition of the algorithms* used in the operations of the data structure.
  
  Characteristics: **Correctness, Time Complexity** (execution time), **Space Complexity** (memory usage).
  
  Terminology: **Data** (set of values), **Data Item** (single unit of values), **Group Items** (Data items that are divided into sub items), **Elementary Items** (Data items that cannot be divided further), **Attribute and Entity** (An entity contains certain attributes or properties),
