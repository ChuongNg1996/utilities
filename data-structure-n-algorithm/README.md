# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Tutorial

* [tutorialspoint-DSA-Home](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm): **Problems?** (1) Speed and (2) Multiple Request **Application?** `Search, Sort, Insert, Update, Delete` (e.g, Fibonacci number series, Knapsack problem, Tower of Hanoi, All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall, Shortest path by Dijkstra, Project scheduling)
* [tutorialspoint-DSA-Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/data_structure_overview.htm):

  Foundation Terms: **Interface** is *set of operations* with *type of parameters* and *return type*, **Implementation** provides *internal representation* of a data structure* and *definition of the algorithms* used in the operations of the data structure.
  
  Characteristics: **Correctness, Time Complexity** (execution time), **Space Complexity** (memory usage).
  
  Terminology: **Data** (set of values), **Data Item** (single unit of values), **Group Items** (Data items that are divided into sub items), **Elementary Items** (Data items that cannot be divided further), **Attribute and Entity** (An entity contains certain attributes or properties), **Entity Set** (Entities of similar attributes), **Field** (single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity), **Record** (a collection of field values of a given entity), **File** (a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set). 

* [tutorialspoint-DSA-Algorithms-Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/algorithms_basics.htm): ... **Space Complexity** = fixed/constant part + variable part. **Time Complexity**  can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the *number of steps*, provided each step consumes *constant time*; or number of *key operations*.
* [tutorialspoint-DSA-Asymptotic-Analysis](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/asymptotic_analysis.htm): **Big O** - Worst Case - express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time; **Big Omega** - Best Case -  express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time; **Big Theta** Average Case - express both the lower bound and the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. [Big O table](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/asymptotic_analysis.htm#_adr_abp_container_7) *(To link to a part of the page with URL -> Inspect the part -> [Look for id](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2835140/how-do-i-link-to-part-of-a-page-hash))*.
* [Greedy Algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/greedy_algorithms.htm): Most networking algorithms use the greedy approach. Here is a list of few of them − Travelling Salesman Problem, Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm, Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm, Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm, Graph - Map Coloring, Graph - Vertex Cover, Knapsack Problem, Job Scheduling Problem. [Divide and Conquer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/divide_and_conquer.htm): The following computer algorithms are based on divide-and-conquer programming approach − Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Strassen's Matrix Multiplication, Closest pair (points)
