## SSH Tunneling: LAN only example

* My setup: 2 PCs/Laptops, one uses Ubuntu 18.04, one uses Ubuntu 20.04.
* Each PC/Laptop can be either server or client. Firstly, install both `OpenSSH Client` and `OpenSSH Server` on both (it's possible that both are already installed):
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install openssh-client
  sudo apt-get install openssh-server
  ```
  To check after install:
  ```sh
  ssh # for OpenSSH Client
  
  
  ```
